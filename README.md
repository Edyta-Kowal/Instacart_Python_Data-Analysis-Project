# Instacart_Python_Data-Analysis-Project

Please note, this project was created as part of the 'Python fundamentals for Data Analysts' course in the CareerFoundry Data Analyst program.

## Context:
Instacart is an established online grocery store that operates through a user-friendly app. With a strong track record of sales, Instacart aims to enhance its understanding of sales patterns by conducting initial data and exploratory analysis. This analysis will help uncover valuable insights and recommend strategies for more effective customer segmentation.

## Goal:
Instacart's primary goal is to refine its marketing approach by targeting various customer segments with tailored campaigns. The company recognizes that one-size-fits-all strategies are not optimal and seeks to optimize its marketing efforts based on data-driven insights.

## Objective:
Conduct an in-depth data analysis of the company's data to provide insights into customer behaviors, purchase patterns, and preferences. By providing actionable insights, I aim to assist the company in refining its marketing strategies and optimizing its approach to target diverse customer profiles effectively.

## Data 
The project was based on open-source data made available online by Instacart:  
'The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017' which was accessed from www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping- 2017 via Kaggle*.  
For my analysis, I utilized the following datasets: 'orders', products' 'orders_products_prior' 'departmentsâ€˜ and 'customers'.    
*Please note, the customer data, as well as the 'prices' column in the products dataset, were both fabricated for educational purposes
